This web app was a great way to level up my Three.js skills in React. I implemented and animated 3D objects from Sketchfab. I used React Fiber and Drei to turn the 3D assets into reusable components. It was extremely challenging yet so much fun! It's also a place to relax and escape. I also created a mapped and mirrored surface on a 3D sphere that can be adjusted live using Leva's GUI tools.

No need to download or install anything in order to see the app, simply navigate to koipond.live and enjoy.
